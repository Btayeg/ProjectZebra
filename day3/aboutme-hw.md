# About Me with HTML

## Introduction
The purpose of this exercise is to practice some basic HTML and then successfully push it all up to _**your private repo**_.

## Setup
Create a directory called `aboutme`, `cd` into `aboutme` and then complete the following:

### Exercise
1. In your `aboutme` directory, use the `touch` command in terminal to create an index.html file and a style.css file.
1. Open sublime text using the `subl .` command to work on your newly created file. You will be creating a basic **'About Me'** in your `index.html`. Link the html and css files together and do your styling in the `style.css` Your site should have at least the following:
  - Picture
  - Name
  - Small Bio (can be completely false if you'd like)
  - Some interests of yours (possibly in an unordered list)
  - A section containing some useful links (github, facebook, twitter, website, wtv)
  - The level of detail you put into this 'mini-site' is entirely up to you, but the more you end up doing the better - practice makes perfect.
1. After you've finished your about me site, go back to your terminal and use `git add .` to add your `aboutme` directory into the staging area. Then use `git commit -m "Add aboutme site exercise"` to commit your work, and then use `git push origin master` to push your committed work to _**your private repo**_.


### Bonus

1. Look into the CSS :hover property. Try to create some interesting content on hover with your About Me page.
2. Check out the following CSS properties and try to implement them.
 - line height
 - border radius
 - box shadows
 - gradient colors
 - media queries
 - keyframe animations
